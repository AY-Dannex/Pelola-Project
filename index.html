<h1><strong> DOGS AND ITS BREEDS</strong></h1>

     <h2> What is a domestic dog?</h2>

    
<div>The term <b>“domestic dog”</b> refers to any of several hundred breeds of dog in the world today.</div> 
<p>While these animals vary drastically in appearance, every dog—from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane—is a member of the same species, Canis familiaris. This separates domestic dogs from wild canines, such as coyotes, foxes, and wolves.</p>
</br><p>Domestic dogs are mostly kept as pets, though many breeds are capable of surviving on their own, whether it’s in a forest or on city streets. A third of all households worldwide have a dog, according to a 2016 consumer insights study. This makes the domestic dog the most popular pet on the planet.</p></body>
